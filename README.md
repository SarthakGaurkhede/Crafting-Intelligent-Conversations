# Crafting-Intelligent-Conversations
Description:

🤖 This repository contains code for building a simple chatbot using TensorFlow and Keras. The chatbot is trained on intents defined in a JSON file and utilizes natural language processing techniques. It employs an embedding layer followed by a dense neural network for classification. The trained model, tokenizer, and label encoder are saved for later use. Additionally, a script is provided for interactive chatting with the trained chatbot.

Key Features:

🚀 Training a chatbot on predefined intents.
🧠 Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras for neural network development.
💾 Saving and loading the trained model, tokenizer, and label encoder.
💬 Interactive chatting interface for real-time interactions with the chatbot.

Files Included:

📝 train_chatbot.py: Script for training the chatbot model.
💬 chatbot.py: Script for interactive chatting with the trained chatbot.
📋 intents.json: JSON file containing predefined intents for training.
🔤 tokenizer.pickle: Pickle file containing the fitted tokenizer.
🏷️ label_encoder.pickle: Pickle file containing the fitted label encoder.
💾 chat_model: Trained model saved in HDF5 format.

Getting Started:

1️⃣ Ensure TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn are installed.
2️⃣ Run train_chatbot.py to train the chatbot model.
3️⃣ Interact with the trained chatbot using chatbot.py.
4️⃣ Enjoy conversing with the chatbot and explore its capabilities!
